# PennyTrax
An app to track and budget your personal finances

## Project Description

We will be creating a cross platform app that will help users visualize their spending broken down by different customized categories. They will be able to connect any supported credit and bank accounts to automatically import transaction history. Additionally, they can set spending goals for each category to help them better budget.

## Team

Our team will be the following individuals and 1 or 2 more if they would like to join.

-   Kyle Okolowitz
-   Skylar Knadler
-   Brayden

## Implementation
We plan to implement the MVP using an SQL and then migrating to a NoSQL.

### SQL
We do not have a relation database selected yet. We might possibly use MySQL.

### NoSQL
We are open to recommendations and will be researching best options for a NoSQL database.

## Bolts

### Business

This will start out as a free to use software application. Anyone will be able to sign up and benefit from it. We plan to develop the MVP as soon as possible so we can get feedback to improve the overall design.

### Operation
The initial team will decide together the operations and direction of the project. Any changes will be made together as needs or goals change.

### Legal
If we plan to go further with the project after completion, the business will be a Utah LLC.

### Technical
Our priorities will be:
1.  Plan out desired features and designs
2.  Research and select the best technologies and tools to use
3. Design database schemas and app architecture 
4. Build and test all features

### Social
We will find users through:

-  Friends and acquaintances
-  Campus
-  Social media
